# Description
Application used for revealing the real player of Hypixel nicks. 

## Installation
 - Go to [releases](https://github.com/DqrkEvil/Hypixel-Denicker/releases) and download [denick.exe](https://github.com/DqrkEvil/Hypixel-Denicker/releases/download/1.1.0/denick.exe)
 - Launch the denick.exe that you just downloaded and you're good to go!
 
 ## Compiling into an executable
 I used [Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) to compile the file into an executable.
 I'm assuming you aren't too new if you want to compile the program yourself, so I won't make too detailed instructions. However, if you are new and need more detailed instructions, feel free to go to [discussions](https://github.com/DqrkEvil/Hypixel-Denicker/discussions/) and ask there.
 To install Pyinstaller just ```pip install pyinstaller```, go to [pyinstaller.org](https://pyinstaller.org) for more detailed instructions.
