# Description
Application used for revealing the real player of Hypixel nicks. 

Got archived due to discontinuation of antisniper.

## Installation
 - Go to [releases](https://github.com/DqrkEvil/Hypixel-Denicker/releases) and download [denick.exe](https://github.com/DqrkEvil/Hypixel-Denicker/releases/download/1.1.0/denick.exe)
 - Launch the denick.exe that you just downloaded and you're good to go!
 
 ## Compiling into an executable
 I used [Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) to compile the file into an executable.
 I'm assuming you aren't too new if you want to compile the program yourself, so I won't make too detailed instructions. However, if you are new and need more detailed instructions, feel free to go to [discussions](https://github.com/DqrkEvil/Hypixel-Denicker/discussions/) and ask there.
 - To install Pyinstaller just run ```pip install pyinstaller```, go to [pyinstaller.org](https://pyinstaller.org) for more detailed instructions.
 - Open CMD and locate the folder (by using cd) containing the denick.py (source code).
 -  In CMD run ```pyinstaller --onefile denick.py```, after a little bit of time a folder called 'dist' should've appeared, within it is the new compiled code.
